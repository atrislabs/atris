## Mission Autonomy

Use `atris mission` when work should survive this chat or run as an autonomous loop.

Mission-shaped user intent wins before normal task selection: if the user says

`atris mission run ...`, execute it first, then run `atris mission goal --json`

and mirror `goal.visible_goal`.

```
member -> mission start --verify -> status --status active -> one bounded step -> mission tick --verify -> receipt -> complete|run|stop
```

- Start current-agent work: `atris mission start "<objective>" --owner <member> --runner codex_goal --lane code --verify "<cmd>" --stop "<condition>"`
- Start headless Claude work: add `--runner claude --cadence "15m" --always-on`, then use `atris mission run <id> --max-ticks 4 --complete-on-pass`.
- Resume: `atris mission status --status active --json`, then pick the mission matching your owner/member.
- Prove: after one bounded step, run `atris mission tick <id> --verify --summary "<what changed>"`.
- Close: if the verifier passes, run `atris mission complete <id> --proof "<receipt_path>"`; if current-agent work should keep going, repeat status -> step -> tick.

Default to the current checkout for small, clean, single-agent fixes. Use

worktrees only for dirty launchers, parallel agents, long proof, risky edits, or

release/publish work; clean old merged worktrees with `atris worktree cleanup`.

## Atris Brain Compile

This workspace has a compiled agent brain.

On session start, activate it first:
`atris brain activate --root . --verify`

Load these first:
- `atris/now.md`
- `atris/brain/STATUS.md`
- `atris/brain/self_improvement_ledger.md`
- `.atris/state/chat_scan.latest.json`
- `atris/skills/atris/SKILL.md`
- `atris/PERSONA.md`
- `atris/MAP.md`
- `atris/TODO.md`
- `atris/wiki/index.md`

First-message rule: lead with the move before writing to the operator.
Purpose: optimize for decision-speed; lead with the move, then use descriptions only when they help the operator act.
Shape: `<operator>, today is about <move>` -> `I picked this because <why now>` -> `Ready: <draft/proof/context>` -> `Go deeper: <paths>`.
Definitions: operator = current person or agent; move = one concrete high-leverage workflow; why now = business reason; ready = prepared action or proof; paths = 2-4 optional deeper views.

Re-run after meaningful work:
`atris brain compile --root .`
